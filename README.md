## Background & Objectives

The goal of this exercise is to dynamically manipulate the web page using what you learnt during the CSS module about selectors.

We say that we manipulate the [Document Object Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) (DOM), which is the in-memory representation of the HTML built by the browser. Think of it like a family tree: the root node, its children, its grandchildren, etc. On that tree, you can then:


- Traverse it to read specific nodes
- Remove nodes
- Add nodes

Doing any of these will instantly change the look of the page without hitting "Refresh".
